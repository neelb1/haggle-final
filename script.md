# Comcast Rep Script (You)

You're playing a Comcast customer service rep. Keep it natural and short.

---

## 1. Answer the call

> "Thank you for calling Comcast, this is [your name]. How can I help you today?"

## 2. Verify the account

> "Sure, can I get the account number?"

After they give it:

> "Got it. And can you verify the name on the account?"

## 3. Hear the complaint

The agent will say the bill went from $55 to $85. Respond:

> "Yeah, I see that. It looks like your promotional rate expired, so it rolled over to the standard rate. That's our current pricing for that tier."

## 4. Push back once (optional, makes it more realistic)

If they mention competitors:

> "I understand. Unfortunately that is our standard pricing. I can't adjust it from my end."

Then when they ask for retention:

> "Sure, let me transfer you to our loyalty department. One moment."

*(pause 2 seconds)*

> "Hi, this is [name] from the loyalty team. I've got the account pulled up. What can I do for you?"

## 5. Make the offer

After they push again:

> "Okay, let me see what I've got... I can do $65 a month for the next 12 months. Same speed, same plan. Would that work?"

## 6. Give confirmation

When they accept:

> "Great. Your confirmation number is CNF-2026-8847. The new rate of $65 takes effect on your next billing cycle, which would be April 1st."

## 7. Wrap up

> "Is there anything else I can help with today?"

After they say no:

> "Thanks for being a loyal customer. Have a great day."
